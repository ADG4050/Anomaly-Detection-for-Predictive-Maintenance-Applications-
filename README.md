# Anomaly-Detection-for-Predictive-Maintenance-Applications-
Anomaly detection using auto encoders for Predictive Maintenance Applications 

The work done is part of EEP55C23 Module "Computations for Transport Engineering" as a part of Msc Electronics Engineering at Trinity College Dublin

The problem is detect Anamoly using Auto Encoders on a predecitive Maintenance Dataset, with different kind of data analysis required using plotly and pandas functions.
